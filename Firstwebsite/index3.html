        <h1>High School</h1>
        <p> It was towards the ending of Middle School where I decided that it was best for me to transfer to a different High School than the one my friends were going to. So I ended up applying for the High School of Art and Design since I already knew art was my calling and after a while, I got accepted!</p>
