        <h1>The present</h1>
        <p> This was far from the end as I had worked up those credits to pass within a few months time. I luckily had the support of many that had grabbed my hand from that endless void and pulled me up to tell me that I shouldn't give up especially when I've came so far. So now I'm studying at the Borough of Manhattan Community College, trying out Animation/Motion Graphics and hoping that my art journey won't end just yet!</p>
